# reactionTimeGame
This project is a timing/reaction time game where one LED will be selected randomly to be the goal and the 
player will try to click either button when the playerâ€™s cursor LED lands on the goal. The speed at which 
the cursor LED goes around the circle will increase with each level, up to level 10. The player will gain 
more points if they catch the goal LED on the first time around, with the points decreasing on each loop. 
Points will be outputted in the serial monitor when the game ends. The switch will be used to turn 
sound effects on/off.
